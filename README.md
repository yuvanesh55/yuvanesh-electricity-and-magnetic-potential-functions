 1. INTRODUCTION
    
 Electric and magnetic potential functions simplify the study of electromagnetic fields. The electric potential represents work done in moving a charge, while the magnetic vector potential describes magnetic   field    behavior. These potentials provide a convenient mathematical framework for deriving electric and magnetic fields and solving complex electromagnetic problems efficiently.
