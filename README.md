# NAME: YUVANESH S P
# REGNO: 212224060315

## **1. INTRODUCTION**

Electric and magnetic potential functions are fundamental tools used in electromagnetic theory.
The **electric potential (V)** represents the work required to move a unit positive charge in an electric field, while the **magnetic vector potential (A)** helps describe magnetic field behavior, especially for complex geometries.
These potentials simplify Maxwell’s equations, aid in solving boundary-value problems, and make the analysis of static and dynamic electromagnetic systems more efficient.

## **2. Electric Potential (Scalar Potential) – V**

The electric potential ( V ) is defined as:

* The potential energy per unit charge
* A scalar quantity
* Related to the electric field by
  [
  \mathbf{E} = -\nabla V
  ]

## **3. Magnetic Potential (Vector Potential) – A**

The magnetic vector potential ( \mathbf{A} ):

* Is a vector field
* Produces the magnetic field using
  [
  \mathbf{B} = \nabla \times \mathbf{A}
  ]
* Helps describe magnetostatic and dynamic magnetic field behavior
